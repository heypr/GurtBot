Gurt is a small Discord bot that lets you download all messages within a channel via the `/downloadmessages` command, Gurt then replies to messages randomly from within that list of messages.

The `/settings` command allows you to modify how frequently Gurt replies to your messages as well as the maximum amount of words that can be sent in a single response.
